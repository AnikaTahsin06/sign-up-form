 This repository contains a simple sign-up form built using HTML and CSS. The project demonstrates fundamental front-end web development skills, focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly form interface.

### Sign-Up Form Project

This project is a responsive sign-up form designed using modern CSS techniques including CSS Grid, Flexbox, and responsive design principles. Below is a detailed description of the project's structure, features, and implementation.

### Project Structure

- **index.html**: This file contains the HTML structure of the sign-up form.
- **styles.css**: This file contains the CSS styles used for layout and design.

### Features

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The form is designed to be fully responsive and adjusts its layout based on the screen size.
   - Utilizes CSS Grid for the main layout and Flexbox for specific elements to ensure flexibility and responsiveness.

2. **CSS Grid Layout**:
   - The `.container` class uses a CSS Grid layout to define a 12-column grid, which helps in organizing the main sections.
   - The `.featured-section` and `.interactive-section` are grid items, ensuring that the layout remains consistent across different screen sizes.

3. **Flexbox**:
   - Flexbox is used for aligning and centering elements within certain grid items, such as the logo and social sign-up buttons.
   - Provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange items within a container, making it easier to manage the layout.

4. **Form Elements**:
   - The form includes fields for full name, email, and password, each with corresponding labels and input fields.
   - Input fields are styled with icons to enhance user experience, using absolute positioning within a relative container for precise placement.

5. **Button and Link Styles**:
   - The sign-up button is styled to provide visual feedback on hover, enhancing user interactivity.
   - Social sign-up buttons are circular with hover effects to encourage user engagement.

6. **Responsive Adjustments**:
   - Media queries are used to adjust the layout for screens narrower than 768px.
   - In mobile view, the `.featured-section` changes background color and the `.interactive-section` adjusts its grid column and row spans for better usability.
   - The logo adapts its display settings based on screen size to ensure optimal visibility.
